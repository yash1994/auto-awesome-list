| [drl_binpacking](https://github.com/alibaba/drl_binpacking) | 3D bin packing is a classical and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in logistics and production systems. An effective bin packing algorithm means the reduction of total packing cost and increase in utilization of resources.  Because the cost of packing materials, which is mainly determined by their surface area, occupies the most part of packing cost, and in many real business scenarios there is no bin with fixed size, so AI Department of Cainiao proposed a new type of 3D bin packing problem. The objective of this new type of 3D bin packing problem is to pack all items into a bin with minimized surface area. And a DRL method based on the sequence-to-sequence model is proposed to solve the problem. This is the research paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05930. Source code of this method can be found in the project. | Python | 38 | N/A |
