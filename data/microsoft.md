| [FairMOT](https://github.com/microsoft/FairMOT) | This project provides an official implementation of our recent work on real-time multi-object tracking in videos. The previous works conduct object detection and tracking with two separate models so they are very slow. In contrast, we propose a one-stage solution which does detection and tracking with a single network by elegantly solving the alignment problem. The resulting approach achieves groundbreaking results in terms of both accuracy and speed: (1) it ranks first among all the trackers on the MOT challenges; (2) it is significantly faster than the previous state-of-the-arts. In addition, it scales gracefully to handle a large number of objects.  | Python | 42 | MIT License |
